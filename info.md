# ha_wind_stat_card

A simple Home Assistant custom card that displays wind speed, gust, and direction as a stacked bar chart with an arrow for current direction. The card fetches history for the configured timeframe and shows up to 60 bars by default. You can adjust this with the `samples` option. The card updates whenever all three sensors update.

See the repository README for installation and configuration details.
