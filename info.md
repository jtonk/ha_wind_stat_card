# ha_wind_stat_card

A Home Assistant custom card that lists the last 10 wind speed, gust and direction values in a two-row table. The first row shows `speed/gust` for each entry, while the second row shows the wind direction. The card pulls history data for the configured sensors and updates automatically.

See the repository README for installation and configuration details.
