# ha_wind_stat_card

A simple Home Assistant custom card that displays wind speed, gust, and direction as a stacked bar chart with an arrow for current direction. The card fetches history for the configured timeframe and updates whenever all three sensors update.

See the repository README for installation and configuration details.
